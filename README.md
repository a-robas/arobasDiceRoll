# ForumActif Dice Roll - EN
(I suck at this, bear with me)

# What for?
The idea for this comes from the fact that I suck at dice roll, and FA's algorithm was... let's say unkind with me. So I decided to make my own. (Also had way too much time on my hands)

# Works with
PHPBB3, ModernBB

# Prerequisites
- JS must be activated
- HTML must be enabled
- Stylesheet must be enabled 

# Files
- The .html file contains the part that's added to the message, indicating your roll. 
- The .css contains the basic style for this (also, it's really ugly, but I'm a backend dev I can't do miracles)
- The .js file contains the script, that's where everything happens. 

# How to set up
1. Grab this repo
2. Create a new html page, named rollPost.html (important!) and add the html in it.
3. Add the css from the .css to your forum css
4. Create a new script and add the .js.
5. Tada. 

# What should it look like?
Upon completion, you will see a new button on the post page - same as when you try to roll a dice using FA's system.
